Flourish Pages TODO
===================

Generic Relationship Management
-------------------------------

Switch to filter form over table design (like /persons).  Put Add/Remove buttons in each row.  Douglas notes that future year groups should be shown as available.

*** In progress. -DC

$PERSON
-------

Need empty message for accordions (I think no table header and just the message, like in Contacts is fine).

./reports
---------

Tables should work for this.  The table should include title(link) and description.

I do propose one data model change, however.  We need to move all types of reports into here, including XML, CSV and XLS exports.  So we need a "type" (or whatever) attribute, and we should have sub-section headers by type.  And then all those exports have to be registered as reports. -TEH

*** In progress. -AE

$PERSON/preferences
-------------------

Implement as modal dialog. -TEH

*** Basic implementation completed. -AE

Styling tbd by DC & TEH.

$PERSON/password
----------------

Just a simple form in a regular page should be sufficient. -TEH

$PERSON/@@person_export.xml
---------------------------

Register as a report
