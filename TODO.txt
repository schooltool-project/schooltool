Flourish Pages TODO
===================

Generic Relationship Management
-------------------------------

Switch to filter form over table design (like /persons).  Put Add/Remove buttons in each row.  Douglas notes that future year groups should be shown as available.

*** Done - DC

$PERSON
-------

Need empty message for accordions (I think no table header and just the message, like in Contacts is fine).

*** Done. -AE.

$PERSON/reports
---------------

Tables should work for this.  The table should include title(link) and description.

I do propose one data model change, however.  We need to move all types of reports into here, including XML, CSV and XLS exports.  So we need a "type" (or whatever) attribute, and we should have sub-section headers by type.  And then all those exports have to be registered as reports. -TEH

*** Done. -AE

$PERSON/request_student_detail.html & $PERSON/request_report_card.html
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Try these as modals.

*** assigned to Alan. 
*** needs to be brought more into line with the style in the pref. dialog

$PERSON/preferences
-------------------

Implement as modal dialog. -TEH

*** Basic implementation completed. -AE

*** Styling basically ok.  Background color probably should be tweaked.

$PERSON/password
----------------

Just a simple form in a regular page should be sufficient. -TEH

*** ???

$PERSON/@@person_export.xml
---------------------------

Register as a report

*** Done -AE



/demographics
-------------

Change title to "Demographics and Personal Information"
Put the add actions in the sidebar, under an "Add" header like in /persons.  We should be able to do those as modals?  We'll fix the wording on those later.
Make a real table with columns:
Title | ID | Type | Required | All (i.e., checked if no limits) | Teach. | Stud. | Admin
That might not all fit.
Show the bools as checkboxes.
I don't think there is any point in having a view view for each field, just a link in the table to the edit view, which can probably be a modal.
