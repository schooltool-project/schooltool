===================================
The SchoolTool Relationship Package
===================================

This package is part of the SchoolTool project. It is released separately,
since it is useful beyond SchoolTool. It requires Zope 3.

This package is a standard distutils package; build it with the command:

    python setup.py build

You can now install it with:

    python setup.py install

You may need to do the later as a priviledged user.
