Example school
==============

This is a description of how to customize schooltool to work in an example
school in an example country.

School structure
----------------

The school is structured into a number of Registration Classes.
Each Pupil in the school is in exactly one Registration Class.
Each Registration Class has a Class Tutor, a teacher who is responsible
for the class and specifically for registering the attendance of pupils.

Exceptions
----------

A registration class may have more than one Class Tutor when tutors are
on vacation, or when trainee teachers take on the tasks of a class tutor.

Registration
------------

Twice on each school day, pupils meet with their class tutor in their class
room to have their attendance registered.
At a registration, each pupil is registered as either
* present
* absent without reason
* absent with reason

A pupil who arrives after registration can see their tutor later and be marked
as "arrived late" instead of "absent without reason".

About two hours after registration, an administrator must be given a list
of all pupils who are absent without reason, so that their legal guardians
can be called.

Absence tracker
---------------

The absence tracker is a persistent object that subscribes to the event
service to receive PupilRegistration events.
It keeps a list of the pupils from each registration class who were marked
as 'absent without reason', and updates this list if pupils are late.

An administrator can check this list at any time.
