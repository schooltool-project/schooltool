Issues with the `refactor` branch
=================================

- There are several XXX.

- Currently every annotatable object can have a timetable. Clearly this is
  undesirable. We should implement a marker interface that is added to objects
  via ZCML that determines the availability of time tables for objects.

- There is an implicit expectation that all objects that can have a timetable
  also provide a title.

- Move the functionality of Person.overlaid_calendars to the view code.

- A generation script has to be written:

   * Convert timetables data attribute to an annotation value. 

- Make the app calendar available via a traversal namespace ++calendar++ or
  develop another more flexible traversal mechnism.

- Build a better preference system where single preference groups can be
  registered. I did a feasibility study and a modified zope.app.preference
  implementation will work.

- Application title is currently SchoolBell.
