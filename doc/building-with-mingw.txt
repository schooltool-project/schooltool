Building SchoolTool extension modules on Windows with MinGW
===========================================================

Download and install MinGW from http://www.mingw.org/ (MinGW-*.exe will do)

Follow the instructions in the Distutils manual, section 6.2.2 (Using
non-Microsoft compilers on Windows: GNU C / Cygwin / MinGW):

  http://www.python.org/doc/current/inst/
  http://www.python.org/doc/current/inst/tweak-flags.html#SECTION000622000000000000000

Add mingw32 to your %PATH% if needed (e.g. `set PATH=%PATH%;c:\mingw\bin`)
before executing `python setup.py build --compiler=mingw32)`.

You should now have a bunch of .pyd files in the build\lib.win32-2.3 directory.
Copy the contents of this directory on top of the src directory to get a
working installation. The directory can also be compressed as it is for easy
distribution.
