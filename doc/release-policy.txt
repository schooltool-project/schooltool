Release Policy for SchoolTool / SchoolBell
==========================================

This policy tries to describe the way that the current release manager performs
a SchoolTool / SchoolBell release. It's purpose is to make the process open and
clear. It is also under continual review.

The current release manager is: Brian Sutherland <jinty@web.de>

Forthcoming Release
-------------------

The next release is of SchoolBell 1.0. Due to the time pressure to include this
release in the next version of Ubuntu, this release will be time based. The
target date for branching the release is 1 March 2005 and the final release on
15 March 2005.

Including Patches in the Release Tree
-------------------------------------

Once the release tree has been branched, the standard way for a patch to be
included is to commit the patch to trunk and notify the release manager by
mail. Patches are expected to be minimal.

The standards by which a patch is judged for inclusion should depend on a
mixture of 2 factors, the severity of the bug and the risk of the patch causing
other breakage. However measuring risk is difficult, so only severity is used
as a metric. As the release process proceeds, the minimum bug severity rises
for patch inclusion.  This has two effects: stopping developers from forever
fixing the branch and keeping the release branch stable (which is different
from bug free).

A good definitions for bug severities can be found at
http://www.debian.org/Bugs/Developer#severities.

Release blocking bugs are bugs for which are severe enough to delay a release
candidate being tagged, these include:

*   Database upgrades are working and tested.

And, for the SchoolBell 1.0 release:

*   Zope 3 transition is complete.

Release Time
------------

There are two ways of choosing the release time: "release when ready" or "time
based release".

If the release is time based, the following timeline is followed:

1.  On the date of the release, a release branch is made of the current trunk.
    From this date, patches fixing important or worse bugs will be accepted
    to the release branch.

2.  Once the release blocking issues are solved, a release candidate is tagged
    from the branch. From this point on, only serious or worse bugfixes are
    accepted.

3.  After some time and testing, the release is made by tagging the release
    branch as final. After this point, only grave bugs or security fixes are
    accepted.

Zope
----

Currently, portions of a Zope X3 checkout are included in the releases. This
has implications for the release:

* The relevant Zope X3 libraries will be included with SchoolBell releases.
* Between SchoolBell releases, the revision of the Zope X3 checkout will be
  pinned to the one released with the last version of SchoolBell.
* A few weeks before the next SchoolBell release the revision will be
  incremented to the current version of the Zope X3 trunk or the Zope X3.1 tag.

This will happen until Zope X3.1 is widely available, after which Zope
libraries will not be released with SchoolBell and compatibility will be
maintained with released versions of Zope.
