This directory contains an experimental prototype of a standalone script
that later become schoolbell-server.py.

The following features were not ported:

  1. The ability to run functional tests over HTTP (testz3sb.py,
     doctesthttp.py, ftests/*.txt)

  2. Database reset view in z3schoolbell.py (@@resetdb.html).

Because some of these features might be useful later, I have not removed this
prototype from subversion.

I am not sure (2) should be ported -- perhaps a better way would be to hook up
DemoStorage with named snapshots, like I did in SchoolTool 0.8.
