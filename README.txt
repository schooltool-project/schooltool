Overview
--------

SchoolTool is an open source school management information system.  It is
a distributed client/server system.  The SchoolTool server presents two
interfaces to clients:

  - a traditional web application interface, usable with an ordinary browser.

  - HTTP-based programming interface suitable for fat clients, adhering to
    the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style (see
    http://rest.blueoxen.net/).

The web application interface is the primary one.  The RESTive interface is
there for potential interoperability with other systems and fat clients to
perform data entry that is inconvenient to do via the web application
interface.

There are several clients that demonstrate the usage of the REST interface
(a command-line client that is used for functional tests, a wxWidgets GUI
client, and a command-line client for data import).

Any modern web browser is suitable for the web application interface.  The
interface degrades gracefully, so a browser that does not support CSS or
Javascript will be usable, although perhaps not very nice or convenient.


System requirements
-------------------

- Python 2.4 (http://www.python.org/)
  (Debian users will need either python2.4 and python2.4-xml packages)

- Zope 3.2 (http://www.zope.org/Products/Zope3)

- libxml2 Python bindings (http://xmlsoft.org/).  Windows users can find
  binaries here:  http://users.skynet.be/sbi/libxml-python/

- the Python Imaging Library (PIL) (http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/)

- (optional) the ReportLab Toolkit (http://www.reportlab.org), and
  Arial and Times New Roman TrueType fonts.  ReportLab is only needed if
  you want to generate PDF calendars.  To enable PDF support you will
  need to specify the path to fonts in the configuration file.


Building and installing SchoolTool from a source tarball
--------------------------------------------------------

From the un-packed tarball you can use the familiar ./configure; make;
make install dance. So, going through it:

$ ./configure --prefix=${libs}

where ${libs} is the location where you want to install the libraries
(it can be anywhere).

$ make
$ make install

Change directory to the installed libraries:

$ cd ${libs}
$ PYTHONPATH=lib/python easy_install -f http://download.zope.org/distribution --install-dir lib/python zc.table

If you don't have the command `easy_install`, please see the following
instructions on how to install it:

http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall#installing-easy-install

Now from the installed libraries, we can test the installation by running:

$ ./bin/schooltooltest -ufv1

Then create a schooltool instance (${instance} is the directory to create the
instance in):

$ ./bin/mkschooltoolinst -d${instance}

Change to the instance and test it:

$ cd ${instance}
$ ./bin/test -ufv --testschooltool

Then you can start the server:

$ ./bin/schooltool-server


Building SchoolTool from a subversion checkout
----------------------------------------------

Run 'make build extract-translations update-translations' to build the
necessary extension modules and translations.  You will need to have gettext
installed to compile the translations.

It is a good idea to run 'make test' and 'make ftest' to check if all the
essential unit and functional tests pass.


Running SchoolTool
------------------

The top-level project directory contains the following executable Python
scripts:

  schooltool-server.py      starts the SchoolTool server

The SchoolTool server automatically creates an empty database if it cannot find
an existing one.  You can customize the location of the database and a few
other parameters in a configuration file called schooltool.conf.  There's
an example file called schooltool.conf.in, you can simply rename it and modify
to suit your needs.

Beware that the file which contains the database, Data.fs, is not given any
special permissions to prevent it from being read by other users by default.
You will have to change the umask or the permissions of the file manually to
prevent unauthorized access.

By default a user with manager privileges is created in the new database.
The username is 'manager', and the password is 'schooltool'.  The database
is otherwise mostly empty.

The default web application port is 7080.  Once the server is running, you can
connect to it with a web browser.

Egg dependencies and checkouts
------------------------------

Schooltool depends on various extensions to Zope 3 that have been
packaged as Python eggs. Sometimes it is important to be able to change
these eggs and make checkins to them during Schooltool dependencies.

What will follow is an example pertaining to the zc.resourcelibrary
package. Note that in order to follow these instructions you need to
have a recent version of setuptools installed (post a11). The most
easy way to do this is to use ez_setup.py, here:

http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall#installing-easy-install

Remove the previously installed egg:

$ cd Zope3/src
$ rm zc.resourcelibrary*

Now do a writeable checkout of zc.resourcelibrary somewhere, for
instance in the schooltool root directory:

$ cd ../..
$ svn co svn+ssh://svn.zope.org/repos/main/zc.resourcelibrary/trunk zc.resourcelibrary

Then install zc.resourcelibrary into Zope3/src in development mode:

$ cd zc.resourcelibrary
$ PYTHONPATH=../Zope3/src/ python setup.py develop --install-dir ../Zope3/src/

(For some reason running this command from within the
zc.resourcelibrary directory seems to be required.)

You can test an development egg dependency with a command like this,
in the Zope3 directory:

$ cd ..
$ cd Zope3
$ python2.4 test.py --test-path=../zc.resourcelibrary/src/ -s zc.resourcelibrary

(this assumes that zc.resourcelibrary has been checked out in the
schooltool root directory)

Some notes on running the tests:

* to run the Zope 3 functional tests, first do a `make inplace` in the
  Zope 3 checkout. zc.resourcelibrary has functional tests.

* Note that the tests will fail as these are functional
  tests. zc.resourcelibrary did not have its configure.zcml or
  meta.zcml installed into Zope 3's package includes.

Testing
-------

There are two sets of automated tests: unit tests and functional tests.
Unit tests (sometimes also called programmer tests) test individual components
of the system.  Functional tests (also called customer or acceptance tests)
test only externally visible behaviour of the whole system.

Tests themselves are scattered through the whole source tree.  Subdirectories
named 'tests' contain unit tests, while subdirectories named 'ftests' contain
functional tests.

To run all unit tests, do

  python test.py -pv

To run all functional tests, do

  python test.py -fpv

The test runner has more options and features.  To find out about them, do

  python test.py -h


Unit test coverage
------------------

All code should be covered by unit tests.  The test runner can help you look
for untested code by producing code coverage reports.

To generate unit test coverage reports, run

  make coverage

This command will run the full SchoolTool unit test suite and produce a
number of files (one for each Python module) in ./coverage/.  Every
report file contains the source of the corresponding Python module.
Each source line is annotated with a number that shows how many times
this line was reached during testing.  Watch out for lines marked with
'>>>>>>' as they indicate code that is not unit tested.

A prettier HTML version of the coverage reports can be generated with

  make coverage
  make coverage-reports-html

Look at HTML files in ./coverage/reports/.  You should have enscript installed
for syntax highlighting source files.

The HTML version of coverage reports is published nightly at
http://source.schooltool.org/coverage/

There are some other helpful make targets:

  make coverage-report-list

    Lists all non-test modules from the schooltool package that contain
    untested code.

  make coverage-report

    Like 'make coverage-report-list', but is somewhat slower and also
    shows the number of untested lines in each module.

  make vi-coverage-reports

    Launches vi for all coverage reports listed by 'make
    coverage-report-list'.  Type />>>>>> to search for untested code,
    then type :next to look at the next report.

  make edit-coverage-reports

    Like 'make vi-coverage-reports' but uses $EDITOR rather than
    hardcoding 'vi'.


Translation
-----------

Translation templates live in src/schooltool/locales/*.pot, they are the
translatable strings extracted from the source. Translation templates are used
to update other translations and create new ones. You can generate them via
this command:

  $ make extract-translations

Translation files live in src/schooltool/locales.  There is a
directory for each language that contains a subdirectory called
LC_MESSAGES that contains the .po files and the compiled .mo files.
The .mo files must be present if schooltool is to use them and are
built by the command:

  $ make update-translations

XXX: At present there is no easy way of compiling .mo files in the
     tarball and the _source_ tarball does not contain them.

To start a new translation, create a language directory and
LC_MESSAGES and use src/schooltool/locales/*.pot as a templates (copy
them to the new directory and rename them as .po).  Generate .mo files
with msgfmt (or by calling make update-translations).


Virtual hosting
---------------

SchoolTool provides support for virtual hosting with Apache's mod_rewrite.
For example, let's say you have two SchoolTool instances running on ports
7001 and 7002, and you want to make them available as school1.example.org
and school2.example.org, both on port 80.  In order to do that, add the
following to your Apache configuration file:

  NameVirtualHost *:80

  <VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName school1.example.org
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteRule ^/(.*) http://localhost:7001/++vh++http:school1.example.org:80/++/$1 [P]
  </VirtualHost>

  <VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName school2.example.org
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteRule ^/(.*) http://localhost:7002/++vh++http:school2.example.org:80/++/$1 [P]
  </VirtualHost>

Also, enable mod_proxy and mod_rewrite.

You can also get SSL support in the same way.

  NameVirtualHost *:443

  <VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerName school1.example.org
    SSLEnable          # Apache 1.3
    # SSLEngine On     # Apache 2.0
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteRule ^/(.*) http://localhost:7001/++vh++https:school1.example.org:443/++/$1 [P]
  </VirtualHost>

The web application interface also supports virtual hosting in this manner,
the only differing thing would be the local port number.
