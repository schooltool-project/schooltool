# Select one storage to use by uncommenting lines in the <zodb> section
# below.
<zodb>

  ## Uncomment the following three lines to use on-disk storage.  You must
  ## specify the full path to the storage file.  The file will be created
  ## automatically if it does not exist, but you must make sure that the
  ## directory exists and that the user running the server has the
  ## permissions required to write to it.

  <filestorage>
    path /var/lib/schooltool-server/Data.fs
  </filestorage>

  ## Uncomment the following line to use nonpersisten in-memory storage.
  ## Note that if you use this, all the data will be lost when the server
  ## is stopped!
