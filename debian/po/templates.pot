#
#    Translators, if you are not familiar with the PO format, gettext
#    documentation is worth reading, especially sections dedicated to
#    this format, e.g. by running:
#         info -n '(gettext)PO Files'
#         info -n '(gettext)Header Entry'
#
#    Some information specific to po-debconf are available at
#            /usr/share/doc/po-debconf/README-trans
#         or http://www.debian.org/intl/l10n/po-debconf/README-trans
#
#    Developers do not need to manually edit POT or PO files.
#
#    ########
#    Please do not waste your time translating the templates from
#    the SchoolBell package. They are exactly the same as the templates
#    from the SchoolTool package and are merged every upstream release.
#
#    Also I would prefer if you translated the original from the repository
#    at http://source.schooltool.org/viewcvs/trunk/schooltool/debian/po
#    You can post the results at schhotool@schooltool.org, or send them
#    directly to me.
#
#    And, Thank You! - schooltool maintainer
