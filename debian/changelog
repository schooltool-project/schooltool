schoolbell (1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use the 'rest' directive rather than the 'listen' directive in config files
    and convert all existing 'listen' directives to 'rest' directives with some
    compatibility code. 'listen' and 'rest' are equivilent, but listen is
    depreciated upstream.
  * Add --retry 30 to start-stop-daemon calls and a small sleep afterwards to
    try to prevent race conditions when the server takes a while to shut down.
  * Remove the code dealing with incompatible databases from 0.7.
  * Do not listen on the RESTive/XML interface by default. See:
    http://lists.schooltool.org/pipermail/schooltool/2005-April/001173.html
  * Update the rules file to the newer way of calling setup.py.
  * Depend on python2.3-libxml2 again.

schoolbell (0.9.99+1.0rc1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Split the schoolbell and schooltool packages. Schoolbell is now spilt into
    2 packages, a configuration package, an arch dependent library package
    containing the Zope extensions. The library package is a temporary package
    as schoolbell needs to contain its own version of Zope until Zope 3.1 is
    packaged. After that, it will become a small arch-indep Zope component.
  * Hack upstreams build process until it does everything debian/rules used to
    do, then reduce and simplify the debian rules. Also the application startup
    scripts are moved to the upstream scripts directory as they will be useful
    for the RPM packages.
  * Use the Zope 3 setup.py script to install the Zope libraries rather than
    finding and copying individual files. Unfortunately this gives no
    fine-grained control over where *.so and *.py files are put, so everything
    goes in an arch-dep package. But it's temporary and the simplification
    is worth it.
  * Remove the dependencies on twisted and pyopenssl as schoolbell 1.0 has
    been rewritten as a pure Zope 3.1 component. Also, the dependency on
    libxml2 has been removed as it is not used in SchoolBell anymore.
  * Rewrite database upgrade code to export/import upgrade databases from
    schoolbell 0.8 and 0.9. Necessary as there was a major structural change
    at schoolbell 1.0.
  * Add `mkdir -p /var/run/schoolbell` to initscript because some people like
    to mount tmpfs on /var/run.
  * Correct name of server in initscript (SchoolTool > SchoolBell).
  * Update README.Debian to have the new default manager password
    (i.e. schoolbell).
  * Removed unimplemented config file options that got lost in the transition
    to a Zope 3 SchoolBell. i.e. 'domain' and 'app-log-file'.
  * Removed the postinst code to generate the 'lang' config file option. This
    is not implemented in the new Zope 3 SchoolBell. It would also probably be
    better to have the server default to reading /etc/environment itself if
    there is a future implementation of 'lang' (iff no lang is defined in the
    config file).
  * Disabled the SSL Certificate generation in the maintainer scripts as the
    server SSL support did not survive the transition to Zope 3. Left the code
    in, just in case that support is added.
  * Added a note that generating SSL certificates might take a while
    (Closes: Bug#297146). (Even though SSL is not available in this release,
    it might be in the future)
  * Remove README.schoolbell from docs as it was removed upstream.
  * Include a new revision of the Zope 3 upsream trunk which has accepted the
    FTBFS patch by Andreas Jochens. (Closes: Bug#298392)

schooltool (0.8.99+0.9rc2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Delete SSL certificate on purge. Ask debconf question whether to purge
    database, using the form used in the proposed database policy at
    http://people.debian.org/~seanius/policy/dbapp-policy.html.
    (Closes: Bug#282369)
  * Change password in debian README back to schooltool. (Closes: Bug#283430)
  * Stop postinst scripts from adding blank lines to config files.
  * Remove un-needed build dependency on python2.3.
  * Make debconf questions for interface setup clearer.
    (Closes: Bug#280698)
  * On first installation, set default locale from default system locale.
  * Change the section of libschooltool and libschooltool-clients to libs.
  * Fix python dependencies to cope with upcoming python version 2.4
    - Use python 2.3 explicitly.
  * Undo past changes of putting some modules in /usr/share. It was a
    violation of the FHS because the .py files are byte-compiled on
    installation. There are now a _LOT_ of lintian warnings about arch-indep
    files in /usr/lib, but this is the lesser evil.
  * Fix package description style to conform to some new lintian warnings and
    fixed spelling errors in templates.
  * Disabled the wxschooltool client and removed it from the packages.
  * Fix bug in setting the default language if /etc/environment does not
    contain LANG=.
  * Added french debconf translation, patch thanks to, Jean-Luc Coulon.
    (Closes: Bug#290389)
  * Re-wrote the package templates for DTSG compliance, patch thanks to,
    Martin Quinson and Christian Perrier. (Closes: Bug#288805)
  * Added chezh translation, patch thanks to Miroslav Kure.
  * Reduced the changes necessary to update packages to a new python version
    to one line in debian/rules and dependencies.Thanks to a suggestion from
    Matthias Klose.
  * Temporarily patch rules to install Zope modules from the Zope tree because
    no Zope 3 package exists yet. Sigh! more lintian warnings, but it's
    temporary and way too much effort to fix these.
  * General cleanup:
    - Removed debdirclean makefile target called from top level directory.
    - Removed dependency references to old schooltool-server package.
  * Fix the database versioning and keep database revision 0.8.
  * Change the default ports for SchoolBell to 7101 for the RESTive interface
    and 7180 for the web interface.
  * Add *.js files to the list of files to install into the server package.

  * Moved configuration file template to /usr/share (Policy 10.7.3).
  * Try to remove configuration file on purge (10.7.3).
  * Depend on ssl-cert rather than copy debconf templates at build.
    Be careful about handling unavailable templates in .config.
  * I18n of schooltool debconf templates with po-debconf.
  * Fixed bug where the ssl_certificate configuration option was not added
    to the configuration file if the certificate existed before installation.
  * Moved the persistent, zope, BTrees and ZDOB modules to /usr/lib and
    removed all links from /usr/share to /usr/lib.
  * Changed priority to extra.
  * Fixed rules so that binary-arch and binary-indep targets build the
    correct packages (Closes: Bug#279111).
  * On log rotation, only restart the server once and do not produce any
    output on success.
  * Changed dependency on python-tcpwrap from suggests to recommends.
  * Added database versioning code. If the database is thought to be
    incompatible, the user is asked in the preinst if it can be deleted.
  * Copy translation files (*.mo) into server package on package build.
  * Add release notes to packages.
  * Merge build the schoolbell package in this source package. The schoolbell
    source package will be removed from debian.
  * schooltool and schoolbell conflict and replace each other
    (Closes: Bug#281621).

schooltool (0.4+svn20040505-0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Packaged subversion snapshot as of 2004-05-05.
  * Split the server and the client parts into separate packages.
  * A number of files had been renamed for a while (e.g.
    /etc/init.d/schooltool was renamed to /etc/init.d/schooltool-server).
    They have now been renamed back.  Hopefully no one used debs built during
    that period, as we have no migration logic in postinst scripts.
  * Added /etc/default/schooltool so that the schooltool server could be
    specified not to load on startup.
