schooltool (0.4+svn20040505-0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Packaged subversion snapshot as of 2004-05-05.
  * Split the server and the client parts into separate packages.
  * A number of files had been renamed for a while (e.g.
    /etc/init.d/schooltool was renamed to /etc/init.d/schooltool-server).
    They have now been renamed back.  Hopefully no one used debs built during
    that period, as we have no migration logic in postinst scripts.
  * Added /etc/default/schooltool so that the schooltool server could be
    specified not to load on startup.
