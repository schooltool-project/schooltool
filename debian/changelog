schooltool (0.7.99+0.8rc1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release: 0.8 release candidate 1.
  * Moved configuration file template to /usr/share (Policy 10.7.3).
  * Try to remove configuration file on purge (10.7.3).
  * Depend on ssl-cert rather than copy debconf templates at build.
    Be careful about handling unavailable templates in .config.
  * I18n of schooltool debconf templates with po-debconf.
  * Fixed bug where the ssl_certificate configuration option was not added
    to the configuration file if the certificate existed before installation.
  * Moved the persistent, zope, BTrees and ZDOB modules to /usr/lib and
    removed all links from /usr/share to /usr/lib.
  * Changed priority to extra.
  * Fixed rules so that binary-arch and binary-indep targets build the
    correct packages (Closes: Bug#279111).
  * On log rotation, only restart the server once and do not produce any
    output on success.
  * Changed dependency on python-tcpwrap from suggests to recommends.
  * Added database versioning code. If the database is thought to be
    incompatible, the user is asked in the preinst if it can be deleted.
  * Copy translation files (*.mo) into server package on package build.
  * Add release notes to packages.
  * Merge build the schoolbell package in this source package. The schoolbell
    source package will be removed from debian.
  * schooltool and schoolbell conflict and replace each other
    (Closes: Bug#281621).

schooltool (0.4+svn20040505-0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Packaged subversion snapshot as of 2004-05-05.
  * Split the server and the client parts into separate packages.
  * A number of files had been renamed for a while (e.g.
    /etc/init.d/schooltool was renamed to /etc/init.d/schooltool-server).
    They have now been renamed back.  Hopefully no one used debs built during
    that period, as we have no migration logic in postinst scripts.
  * Added /etc/default/schooltool so that the schooltool server could be
    specified not to load on startup.
