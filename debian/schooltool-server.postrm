# summary of how this script can be called:i
#       * <postrm> `remove'
#       * <postrm> `purge'
#       * <old-postrm> `upgrade' <new-version>
#       * <new-postrm> `failed-upgrade' <old-version>
#       * <new-postrm> `abort-install'
#       * <new-postrm> `abort-install' <old-version>
#       * <new-postrm> `abort-upgrade' <old-version>
#       * <disappearer's-postrm> `disappear' <overwriter>
#         <overwriter-version>
# for details, see http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ or
# the debian-policy package
#
# quoting from the policy:
#     Any necessary prompting should almost always be confined to the
#     post-installation script, and should be protected with a conditional
#     so that unnecessary prompting doesn't happen if a package's
#     installation fails and the `postinst' is called with `abort-upgrade',
#     `abort-remove' or `abort-deconfigure'.
# and:
# Log files should be removed when the package is purged (but not when it 
# is only removed). This should be done by the postrm script when it is 
# called with the argument purge (see Details of removal and/or 
# configuration purging, Section 6.7).
