Debian Package Todo
-------------------

*   Kick Zope 3 out of the package.

    Prerequisites:
        - Zope 3.1 package in Debian and Ubuntu.
        - Trunk to work with the above package.

*   Put architecture independent files into /usr/share/schooolbell
    How: ????

*   Use db-config common when it becomes available.

*   Big cleanup day of compatibility code:
    *   db_upgrade script (We will use Zope Generations grom now on)
    *   db_delete code (Already obsolete, but useful if someone upgrades from
        0.7)
