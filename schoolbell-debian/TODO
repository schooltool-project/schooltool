Debian Package Todo
-------------------

*   Kick Zope 3 out of the package.

    Prerequisites:
        - Zope 3 package in Debian and Ubuntu.
        - Trunk to work with the above package.

*   Put architecture independent files into /usr/share/schooolbell
    How:
        patch the Template class
        jinty thanks.
        mgedmin override get_path_from_prefix
        mgedmin also change read_file in the same module (src/schooltool/rest/__init__.py)
        mgedmin recursively grep the source tree for __file__ just to be safe
        jinty Running the functional tests on the server in a chroot enough to catch everything?
        mgedmin our functional tests for the web interface are not very complete
        jinty ah, ok then, leave it to the users
        mgedmin I suggest looking at a couple of pages with a bro%s/\s\+$//er
        jinty ok
        mgedmin if you see text, images and css, then it works
        mgedmin I do not think there are any other arch-indep files in there
        mgedmin maybe zconfig's schema.xml
        mgedmin maybe our relaxng schemas, but patching read_file() should fix them
        jinty Ok, i'll give it a try, probably for 0.10
