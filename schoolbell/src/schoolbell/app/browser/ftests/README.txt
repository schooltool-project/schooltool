Tips and tricks for writing functional doctests
-----------------------------------------------

- Start with a .txt file generated by Zope's doctest generator, or just
  copy and paste an existing doctest and change requests/responses manually.

- Replace "Authorization: Basic (whatever goes here)" with
  "Authorization: Basic mgr:mgrpw"

- Replace "Content-Length: (a number)" with "Content-Length: ..." in the output
  (but not in the input!)

- Remove all port numbers after 'localhost' (e.g., if you used tcpwatch and
  went to http://localhost:9080/, then in your .txt file replace all instances
  of "localhost:9080" with just "localhost").

- Replace a number of long boring lines with a single ellipsis (...).

- When you get a huge diff, look for lines that start with a question mark (?),
  they are most informative.
