Release Notes - SchoolBell 1.0
==============================

This is the first release of SchoolBell separately from SchoolTool. It also
marks the completion of the transition of SchoolBell to being a component in
the Zope3 framework and the start of full forward database compatibility.

The application was basically re-written and a number of features have not yet
been ported from SchoolBell 0.9, however, the integration with Zope 3 provides
a good basis going forward.

SchoolBell can now be used as a stand alone server as well as a Zope 3
component integrated with the ZMI.

Known Issues
------------

Zope Version Compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This version of SchoolBell has been developed and tested with the Zope 3
trunk revision 29357. It may, but probably won't, work with other revisions.

For this reason, included in the official tarball, is a stripped down Zope3 of
this revision with enough libraries to run SchoolBell as a stand alone server.


Database Upgrades
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This release will do a *partial* import of a database from the previous version
of SchoolTool or SchoolBell. Only all persons and resources and their calendars
are migrated, along with groups, their calendars and membership information.
Other data, including school-related data like timetables and time periods is
not migrated.

Full upgrades will be maintained from this release onwards.

To upgrade your 0.8/0.9 instace to 1.0, follow the instructions in
scripts/run-export.sh and scripts/run-import.sh.

Note that these scripts require the libraries that come with SchoolTool 0.9.
If you already installed SchoolBell 1.0 or removed your previous installation
simply download and build (but do not install) the 0.9 release.


Unimplemented features from SchoolBell 0.9
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some features were unable to make the transition from the twisted framework to
the Zope 3 framework, or were un-implemented at the time of the release due to
the time based release method. Those which make sense will be implemented later
and those which don't, will be dropped.

* native server SSL
* ReST interface
* i18n
* Resource Booking
* TCPWrapper integration
