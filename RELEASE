Release Notes - SchoolBell 1.0
==============================

This is the first release of SchoolBell separately from SchoolTool. It also
marks the completion of the transition of SchoolBell to being a component in
the Zope3 framework and the start of full database database compatibility.

This is aside from other wonderful features such as timezones, all day events
etc...

Enough for it to be 1.0!

Major Changes from 0.9
----------------------

TODO - Remove those features not in time for release.

Contributions by POV:

* Integration with the Zope 3 framework and ZMI. SchoolBell is now a collection
  of re-usable Zope 3 components that can be used in other Zope 3 applications.
* Separate iCalender Parser which only depending on the python standard library.
  (TODO am I right?)
* Don't worry, SchoolBell can still be run as a stand alone server
