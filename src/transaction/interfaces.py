    implement this. They should implement ZODB.interfaces.IDataManager

    like this or that this interface will evolve and become the
    standard interface. There are some issues to be resolved first, like:

      two-phase commit.

    - The savepoint api may need some more thought.

        persistent.  A normal return from this method indicated that
        the data manager is ready to commit the changes.

        The data manager must raise an exception if it is not prepared
        to commit the transaction after executing prepare().

        savepoints, if any.

        protocol.  If this call fails, or if a rollback call on the
        result fails, the (containing) transaction should be
        aborted.  Aborting the containing transaction is *not* the
        responsibility of the data manager, however.

        An implementation that doesn't support savepoints should
        implement this method by returning a rollback implementation
        that always raises an error when it's rollback method is
        called. The savepoing method shouldn't raise an error. This
