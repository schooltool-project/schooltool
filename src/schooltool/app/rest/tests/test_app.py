    Lets create a schooltool instance and make a view for it:

        >>> from schooltool.app.rest.app import ApplicationView
        >>> setup.placefulSetUp()
        >>> app = sbsetup.setUpSchoolToolSite()
        >>> view = ApplicationView(app, TestRequest())
        >>> result = view.GET()

    Lets test the XML output:

        >>> from schooltool.common.xmlparsing import XMLDocument
        >>> doc = XMLDocument(result)
        >>> doc.registerNs('xlink', 'http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink')

    There should only be one set of containers:

        >>> nodes = doc.query('/schooltool/containers')
        >>> len(nodes)
        1

    Let's test our containers:

    persons:

        >>> persons = doc.query('/schooltool/containers/container'
        ...                     '[@xlink:href="http://127.0.0.1/persons"]')[0]
        >>> persons['xlink:type']
        u'simple'
        >>> persons['xlink:title']
        u'persons'

    groups:

        >>> groups = doc.query('/schooltool/containers/container'
        ...                     '[@xlink:href="http://127.0.0.1/groups"]')[0]
        >>> groups['xlink:type']
        u'simple'
        >>> groups['xlink:title']
        u'groups'

    resources:

        >>> resources = doc.query('/schooltool/containers/container'
        ...                     '[@xlink:href="http://127.0.0.1/resources"]')[0]
        >>> resources['xlink:type']
        u'simple'
        >>> resources['xlink:title']
        u'resources'

    sections:

        >>> sections = doc.query('/schooltool/containers/container'
        ...                     '[@xlink:href="http://127.0.0.1/sections"]')[0]
        >>> sections['xlink:type']
        u'simple'
        >>> sections['xlink:title']
        u'sections'

    courses:

        >>> courses = doc.query('/schooltool/containers/container'
        ...                     '[@xlink:href="http://127.0.0.1/courses"]')[0]
        >>> courses['xlink:type']
        u'simple'
        >>> courses['xlink:title']
        u'courses'

    that's all of our containers:

        >>> doc.free()

    XXX this is what our output should look like:

    XXX mg: who wrote the XXX above, and what does it mean?

    Cleanup:

        >>> setup.placefulTearDown()
