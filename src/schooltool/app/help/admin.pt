<h1>SchoolTool Administration</h1>
<p>Schools have complex structures, spanning the organization of people, 
pedagogy, time and physical resources.  Unfortunately, this means that an 
application that seeks to model these processes, like SchoolTool, is also 
complex, and the process of setting up an individual school in SchoolTool is 
necessarily an involved one.</p>
<p>This branch of the help tree contains items relevant to administrators 
configuring SchoolTool, but not end users.</p>
