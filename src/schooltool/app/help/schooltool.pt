<h1 i18n:translate="">SchoolTool</h1>
<p i18n:translate="">SchoolTool is a free/libre administrative system for 
schools around the world, funded by The Shuttleworth Foundation.</p>
<h2 i18n:translate="">Standard User Interface Conventions in SchoolTool</h2>
<ul>
<li i18n:translate=""><strong>Red top bar</strong></li>
<ul>
<li i18n:translate=""><strong>Breadcrumbs:</strong> the links at the left hand side of the
red bar show you where you are in SchoolTool's object hierarchy.  Note that 
this doesn't necessarily lead you back to where you came from, but is 
handy for taking you from more specific to more general parts of the 
application.</li>
<li i18n:translate=""><strong>Your name</strong> (if you're logged in):
clicking on your name takes you 
to a simple dashboard of relevant links.  From this page you can also 
use the <code>Actions</code> menu to change preferences and other personal
settings.</li>
<li i18n:translate=""><strong>Log in/out:</strong> this logs you in or out.  
It is a good idea to log out when you aren't using SchoolTool.</li>
<li i18n:translate=""><strong>Help:</strong> if there is a help file for the 
page you're looking at, you'll see this link.</li>
</ul>
<li i18n:translate=""><strong>Menus</strong></li>
<ul>
<li i18n:translate=""><strong>Navigation:</strong> this menu gives you some 
basic options for accessing different parts of SchoolTool, such as the 
index of persons or courses.  What you see here depends on your permissions 
in the system.</li>
<li i18n:translate=""><strong>Action:</strong> this menu contains a variety 
of things that you can do on the current page.  The entries in this menu 
change considerably based on what page you're viewing and what permissions 
you have.</li>
</ul>
<li i18n:translate=""><strong>Above the red bar</strong></li>
<ul>
<li i18n:translate=""><strong>Logo & School Name:</strong> clicking in this 
area will take you to the top of the school's site, usually the calendar 
for the school.</li>
<li i18n:translate=""><strong>Calendar day/week/month/year views:</strong>
if you are viewing a calendar, you will find icons in the upper right hand 
corner that will allow you to switch between calendar views.</li>
<li i18n:translate=""><strong>Devmode menu:</strong> if you are a site 
administrator and you've enabled "devmode" in schooltool.conf, you will 
see a special menu in the upper right hand corner of the site.  You should 
disable devmode in any production server.</li>
