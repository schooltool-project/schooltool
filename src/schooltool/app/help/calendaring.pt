<h1 i18n:translate="">Calendaring in SchoolTool</h1>
<p i18n:translate="">SchoolTool includes a full-featured calendaring system,
similar to Apple iCal or Google Calendar, but capable of representing 
complex school timetables, including rotating schedules.  Each person, 
group, course section or resource (such as a room or a projector) has its 
own calendar.  You may integrate multiple calendars into your personal 
calendar views.</p>
<h3 i18n:translate="">Parts of the standard calendar views</h3>
<ul>
<li i18n:translate=""><strong>Calendar table:</strong> fills the main 
(lower-right) part of the page.  This represents the calendar for one day, 
week, month or year, depending on the view..</li>
<li i18n:translate=""><strong>Calendar navigation bar:</strong> immediately 
above the calendar table.  Allows you to navigate forward or backward in time, 
or to return to the current time.</li>
<li i18n:translate=""><strong>Calendar title:</strong> immediately above the 
calendar navigation bar, lists the owner of this calendar and the date for this 
"page" of the calendar.</li>
<li i18n:translate=""><strong>Left sidebar:</strong> for all calendars, this 
contains a <code>Jump to...</code> section containing menus and links to allow 
you to quickly navigate to a specific month, year or date.  <br />  If you 
are logged in and viewing your own calendar, you will also see a 
<code>Calendars</code> section at the top of the sidebar which allows you 
to "overlay" events from other calendars in this view.  You may see 
calendars for classes you teach or attend listed here already.</li>
<li i18n:translate=""><strong>Day/week/month/year buttons:</strong> These 
buttons allow you to switch between daily, weekly, monthly and annual 
views.</li>
</ul>
