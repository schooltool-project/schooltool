<h1 i18n:translate="">Add Event</h1>
<p i18n:translate="">This form has a few issues:</p>
<ul>
<li i18n:translate="">If you need to reserve a resource, such as a room or
a projector, tracked by SchoolTool at your school, you should create an event 
for the necessary time and check the <code>Book Resources</code> 
checkbox at the bottom of the page.</li>
<li i18n:translate="">The form ignores your preferences for time and date format.
You must enter the event's start time in 24-hour or "military" time, and 
the date is displayed in year-month-day format.</li>
<li i18n:translate="">The <code>Location</code> field allows you to enter 
a description of the location of the event, but this is not connected to the 
reservation system.  If your school uses SchoolTool to manage room reservations 
you need to check the <code>Book Resources</code> checkbox at the bottom
of the form.</li>
<li i18n:translate="">If your event repeats in some pattern, check the 
<code>Recurring</code> box and fill out the new fields that appear.  In 
certain circumstances (like if you change the original day of a weekly 
recurring event) you may need to click the <code>Update form</code> button 
to update the recurrence fields.</li>
<li i18n:translate="">An "all day" event does not show up as a 24 hour event.
It indicates that the day as a whole has some significance, like a birthday 
or holiday.</li>
<li i18n:translate="">"Exception dates" are specific dates a repeating event 
skips, such as holidays.</li>
</ul>
