Contextual Help
===============

The contextual help provides help screens for particular views. Let's first
log in however.

    >>> from zope.testbrowser import Browser
    >>> manager = Browser()
    >>> manager.open('http://localhost/')
    >>> manager.getLink('Log In').click()
    >>> manager.getControl('Username').value = 'manager'
    >>> manager.getControl('Password').value = 'schooltool'
    >>> manager.getControl('Log in').click()

Now we are the calendar. A you can see there is no help link here, since there
is no help for this link:

    # I know this is a brittle test, but I do not want to overdo the test
    # setup here.
    >>> 'Context Help' in manager.contents
    False

But when we go to the person container, for example, we should be able to see
the help:

    >>> manager.getLink('persons').click()
    >>> 'Context Help' in manager.contents
    True

In reality, you would now click on the link and a new window should open with
the content. Since our test-browser does not support Javascript, we have to do
this manually:

    >>> manager.open('http://localhost/persons/++help++/contexthelp.html')

    >>> print manager.contents
    <!DOCTYPE...
    ...
    <title>Person Container - Contents</title>
    ...
    <div class="content"><p>This screen provides a list of all people
    defined in their SchoolTool instance.</p>
    ...
