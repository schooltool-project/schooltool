<h1>Terms in SchoolTool</h1>
<p>SchoolTool supports definition of basic academic terms, that is, 
a period of time which defines when sections begin and end, and when they are 
evaluated.  The current implementation does not support a hierarchy of terms, 
for example, a year, which contains two semesters, which contain two marking 
periods.  You can create several terms, which may overlap, 
for example, both semesters and trimesters in the same school, 
but you cannot express a relationship between terms.</p>
<h3>How do I...</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Add a term:</strong>  Select <code>New Term</code> from the 
<code>Actions</code> menu.</li>
<li><strong>Edit a term:</strong>  Click on the term.  Then select 
<code>Edit</code> from the <code>Actions</code> menu.</li>
<li><strong>Delete a term:</strong>  Check the box next to the name of the term 
and click <code>Delete</code>.  Only delete terms if you have made a mistake 
while creating them but you have not used them yet.  You should 
<strong>not</strong> delete terms simply because they are over, or you will 
lose important data.</li>  
</ul>
