<p>Use this page to keep track of <b>groups</b> of Persons.</p>

<p><b>Groups</b> that have been added are not part of the essential
groups (<b>Teachers</b>, <b>Students</b>, <b>Site Managers</b>, <b>School
Administrators</b>, or <b>Clerks</b>).  They can be selected by the checkbox
next to them and removed by pressing the <b>Delete</b> button at the bottom
of the page.</p>

<p>To look for for a group, use the search box to the left of the <b>Find
Now</b> button to look through the entire list of groups for the search
criterion.</p>

<p>The <b>Clear</b> button empties the search box of current entries.</p>

<p>To view the persons in a certain group, click on the name of the group.</p>

<p>To sort the list, click on the <b>Title</b> header to change the order of
groups from descending to ascending order, and vice versa.</p>

<p>Separate <q>batches</q> of the Group list can be accessed through the
<b>Next 10</b> (and <b>Previous</b>) and links in the blue bar.</p>

<p>A <b>Show All</b> button is also there to show all of the groups on a
single page.</p>
