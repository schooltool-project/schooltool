    The problem happens like this: we have a Person in the application.

    There is another person, but it has been deleted

    The first person has overlaid the dead person's calendar.

        <...CalendarOverlayInfo object at ...>

    (In real life, dead_person was alive when person overlaid his
    calendar, but then dead_person got removed.  The late person's
    calendar was supposed to be removed from all overlays, but that
    didn't happen because of a bug.)

    This evolution script is supposed to clean up such stale calendars
    from overlay lists.

        >>> from schooltool.generations.evolve6 import evolve

    We can see that the stale calendar is gone now:
