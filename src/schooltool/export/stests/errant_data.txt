Tests for errant import data
----------------------------

Log in as manager:

    >>> import os
    >>> manager = browsers.manager
    >>> manager.ui.login('manager', 'schooltool')

We'll define a helper function for calling the import helper wth the full
filename and printing out the errors.

    >>> def import_file(filename):
    ...     dirname = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__))
    ...     filename = os.path.join(dirname, filename)
    ...     manager.ui.import_xls(filename)
    ...     errors = manager.query_all.css('textarea').text
    ...     if errors:
    ...         lines = [l.strip() for l in errors[0].split('\n') if l.strip()]
    ...         print '\n'.join(lines)
