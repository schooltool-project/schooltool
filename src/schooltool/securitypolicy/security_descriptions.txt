Describing SchoolTool Access Rights
===================================

SchoolTool employs a custom crowd security policy, that calculates
access rights when accessing a particular object.  This gives
developers the freedom of having different access rights for objects
of the same type.

Various security scenarios have been implemented, for example:
- calendar access rights that are decided by the object the calendar
belongs to (resource calendars, section calendars, etc.).
- additional access rights on a section if a person is an instructor
of that section.
- application setting that allows person information to be viewed by
everybody.

As access rights are determined in python when accessing an object, it
is difficult to fully automate building of access right
descriptions. Actually, it is even difficult to automate description
of the SchoolTool object model.


Describing Object Model
-----------------------

When developers write the code, they think of objects in terms of
"what it is" and "what it does".  However, we want to present users
with "what you see" and "what you can do with it".

For example, from developers point of view, you need *schooltool.edit*
permission on a *Timetable* object adapted from a Section to modify a
section's timetable.  From the users perspective, you actually need
access rights to *change the schedule* of *a section*.
