Timetable model implementations.

A timetable model describes the mapping between timetable days and calendar
days, and also the mapping between period IDs and time of the day.  Currently
SchoolTool has two kinds of timetable models:

  - Sequential days model may jump over calendar days if they are not school
    days.  For example, if July 3 was timetable day 3, and July 4 is a holiday,
    then July 5 will be timetable day 4.

  - Weekly model maps week days directly to timetable days, that is, Monday is
    always timetable day 1, and sunday is always timetable day 7.

It is possible to define additional models.  See ITimetableModel.
