"""ZODB database interfaces and exceptions

The Zope Object Database (ZODB) manages persistent objects using
pickle-based object serialization.  The database has a pluggable
storage backend.

The IAppDatabase, IAppConnection, and ITransaction interfaces describe
the public APIs of the database.

The IDatabase, IConnection, and ITransactionAttrs interfaces describe
private APIs used by the implementation.
