"""Manage the asyncore mainloop in a multi-threaded app

In a multi-threaded application, only a single thread runs the
asyncore mainloop.  This thread (the "mainloop thread") may not start
the mainloop before another thread needs to perform an async action
that requires it.  As a result, other threads need to coordinate with
the mainloop thread to find out whether the mainloop is running.

This module implements a callback mechanism that allows other threads
to be notified when the mainloop starts.  A thread calls
register_loop_callback() to register interest.  When the mainloop
thread calls loop(), each registered callback will be called with the
socket map as its first argument.
