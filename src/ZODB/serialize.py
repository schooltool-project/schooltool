"""Support for ZODB object serialization.

ZODB serializes objects using a custom format based on Python pickles.
When an object is unserialized, it can be loaded as either a ghost or
a real object.  A ghost is a persistent object of the appropriate type
but without any state.  The first time a ghost is accessed, the
persistence machinery traps access and loads the actual state.  A
ghost allows many persistent objects to be loaded while minimizing the
memory consumption of referenced but otherwise unused objects.

Pickle format
-------------

ZODB stores serialized objects using a custom format based on pickle.
Each serialized object has two parts: the class metadata and the
object state.  The class description must provide enough information
to call the class's ``__new__`` and create an empty object.  Once the
object exists as a ghost, its state is passed to ``__setstate__``.

The class metadata can be represented in two different ways, in order
to provide backwards compatibility with many earlier versions of ZODB.
The class metadata is always a two-tuple.  The first element may also
be a tuple, containing two string elements: name of a module and the
name of a class.  The second element of the class metadata tuple is a
tuple of arguments to pass to the class's ``__new__``.

Persistent references
---------------------

A persistent reference is a pair containing an oid and class metadata.
When one persistent object pickle refers to another persistent object,
the database uses a persistent reference.  The format allows a
significant optimization, because ghosts can be created directly from
persistent references.  If the reference was just an oid, a database
access would be required to determine the class of the ghost.

Because the persistent reference includes the class, it is not
possible to change the class of a persistent object.  If a transaction
changed the class of an object, a new record with new class metadata
would be written but all the old references would still include the
old class.
