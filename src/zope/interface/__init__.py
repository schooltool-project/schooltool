"""Interfaces

This package implements the Python "scarecrow" proposal.

The package exports two names, 'Interface' and 'Attribute' directly.
Interface is used to create an interface with a class statement, as
in:



  class IMyInterface(Interface):
    '''Interface documentation
    '''

    def meth(arg1, arg2):
        '''Documentation for meth
        '''

    # Note that there is no self argument

To find out what you can do with interfaces, see the interface
interface, IInterface in the IInterface module.

The package has several public modules:

  XXX This docstring needs to be updated after the Grand Renaming.

  o Attribute has the implementation for interface attributes
    for people who want to build interfaces by hand.
    (Maybe someone should cry YAGNI for this. ;)

  o Document has a utility for documenting an interface as structured text.

  o Exceptions has the interface-defined exceptions

  o IAttribute defines the attribute descriptor interface.

  o IElement defined the base interface for IAttribute, IInterface,
    and IMethod.

  o IInterface defines the interface interface

  o IMethod defined the method interface.

  o Implements has various utilities for examining interface assertions.

  o Method has the implementation for interface methods. See above.

  o Verify has utilities for verifying (sort of) interfaces.

See the module doc strings for more information.

There is also a script, pyskel.py in the package that can be used to
create interface skeletons. Run it without arguments to get documentation.
