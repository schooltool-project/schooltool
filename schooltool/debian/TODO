Debian Package Todo
-------------------

*   Play better with the Zope packages, speak to Mattias Klose.

*   Do something about all the documentation scattered in the source in the form
    of *.txt doctests. It is completely ignored and not installed.

*   Use dbconfig-common as much as possible.
