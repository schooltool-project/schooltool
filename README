Overview
--------

SchoolTool is an open source school management information system.  It is
a distributed client/server system.  The SchoolTool server presents two
interfaces to clients:

  - a traditional web application interface, usable with an ordinary browser.

  - HTTP-based programming interface suitable for fat clients, adhering to
    the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style (see
    http://rest.blueoxen.net/).

The web application interface is the primary one.  The RESTive interface is
there for potential interoperability with other systems and fat clients to
perform data entry that is inconvenient to do via the web application
interface.

There are several clients that demonstrate the usage of the REST interface
(a command-line client that is used for functional tests, a wxWidgets GUI
client, and a command-line client for data import).

Any modern web browser is suitable for the web application interface.  The
interface degrades gracefully, so a browser that does not support CSS or
Javascript will be usable, although perhaps not very nice or convenient.


System requirements
-------------------

- Python 2.3 (http://www.python.org/)
  (Debian users will need both python2.3 and python2.3-xml packages)

- libxml2 Python bindings (http://xmlsoft.org/)

- Twisted 1.3.0 or newer (http://www.twistedmatrix.com/)
  (needed for the server only)

- Python Imaging library (http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/index.htm)
  (needed for the server only)

- wxPython 2.4 (http://www.wxpython.org/)
  (needed for the wxWidgets client only)

- pyOpenSSL (http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyopenssl/)
  (needed for the server only)

- Development environment and a C compiler
  (precompiled binaries are available for Windows users)


Optional Extras
---------------

- PyTCPWrap (http://ples.sourceforge.net/index.cgi?PyTCPWrap)
  (useful for the server only)


Building SchoolTool
-------------------

Run 'make' to build the necessary extension modules.

It is a good idea to run 'make test' and 'make ftest' to check if all the
essential unit and functional tests pass.


Installing and Configuring with Distutils
-----------------------------------------

It is possible to install SchoolTool and SchoolBell using the python distutils.
To do this, you have to use one of the distributed tarballs/zip files, which
you unpack in a directory with the tools appropriate to your OS. First, it is
necessary to install the version of Zope included with the tarballs, this can
be done by running

python setup.py install

from the Zope3/ directory included with the SchoolBell distribution. From the
top level directory, the commands

python setup.py install (inside the unpacked schoolbell tarball/zip)
python setup.py install (inside the unpacked schooltool tarball/zip)

will install SchoolBell and SchoolTool respectively. Note that SchoolTool
depends on SchoolBell, so you will have to install both if you want to run
SchoolTool.

Finally, to setup a SchoolBell / SchoolTool instance, copy the installed script
into a separate directory and create a config file with the name of the script
and an extension .conf. A good template can be found in the top level of the
tarball (.conf.in). Running this script will then run an instance in that
directory.

Those interested in installing into a non-standard location should investigate
the --paths and --default-config option for the install distutils commands.

NOTE: If you are using a Linux distribution for which packages exist, you
should consider using those packages instead of this procedure.


Running SchoolTool
------------------

The top-level project directory contains the following executable Python
scripts:

  schooltool-server.py      starts the SchoolTool server
  schoolbell-server.py      starts the SchoolBell server
  schooltool-client.py      starts the command line client
  generate-sampleschool.py  generates sample school data
  import-sampleschool.py    imports sample data into the server

The SchoolTool server automatically creates an empty database if it cannot find
an existing one.  You can customize the location of the database and a few
other parameters in a configuration file called schooltool.conf.  There's
an example file called schooltool.conf.in, you can simply rename it and modify
to suit your needs.

By default a user with manager privileges is created in the new database.
The username is 'manager', and the password is 'schooltool'.  The database
is otherwise mostly empty, but you can run import-sampleschool.py to populate
it with some sample data.

The default web application port is 7080.  Once the server is running, you can
connect to it with a web browser.

The Makefile also contains several shortcuts, which are kept mainly for
backwards-compatibility:

  make sampleschool         generates and imports sample data into the server

  make run                  starts the SchoolTool server
  make runtestserver        starts the SchoolTool server using test.conf as the
                            configuration file (this is used for running
                            automated functional tests)

  make runclient            starts the command line client

These commands are superseded by executable Python scripts in the top-level
directory.

Testing
-------

There are two sets of automated tests: unit tests and functional tests.
Unit tests (sometimes also called programmer tests) test individual components
of the system.  Functional tests (also called customer or acceptance tests)
test only externally visible behaviour of the whole system.

Tests themselves are scattered through the whole source tree.  Subdirectories
named 'tests' contain unit tests, while subdirectories named 'ftests' contain
functional tests.

To run all unit tests, do

  python2.3 test.py -pv

To run all functional tests, start the SchoolTool server using the test.conf
configuration file (hint: make runtestserver) and then do

  python2.3 test.py -fpv

The test runner has more options and features.  To find out about them, do

  python2.3 test.py -h

Functional tests are are not completely isolated.  Some functional tests
create named database state snapshots, while other tests reuse those snapshots
of known database state.  The test runner does not know which tests create
which snapshots, so if you want to run just one (or a couple) of functional
tests in isolation, it is likely that you will have first run the full suite
to create the necessary snapshots.  Do not restart the test server, or all
saved snapshots will be gone.


Unit test coverage
------------------

All code should be covered by unit tests.  The test runner can help you look
for untested code by producing code coverage reports.

To generate unit test coverage reports, run

  make coverage

This command will run the full SchoolTool unit test suite and produce a
number of files (one for each Python module) in ./coverage/.  Every
report file contains the source of the corresponding Python module.
Each source line is annotated with a number that shows how many times
this line was reached during testing.  Watch out for lines marked with
'>>>>>>' as they indicate code that is not unit tested.

There are some more helpful make targets:

  make coverage-report-list

    Lists all non-test modules from the schooltool package that contain
    untested code.

  make coverage-report

    Like 'make coverage-report-list', but is somewhat slower and also
    shows the number of untested lines in each module.

  make vi-coverage-reports

    Launches vi for all coverage reports listed by 'make
    coverage-report-list'.  Type />>>>>> to search for untested code,
    then type :next to look at the next report.

  make edit-coverage-reports

    Like 'make vi-coverage-reports' but uses $EDITOR rather than
    hardcoding 'vi'.


Translation
-----------

Translation files live in src/schooltool/translation.  There is a directory
for each language that contains a subdirectory called LC_MESSAGES that
contains two files: schooltool.po and schooltool.mo.

To start a new translation, create a language directory and LC_MESSAGES and
use src/schooltool/translation/schooltool.pot as a template.  Generate
schooltool.mo with msgfmt (or by calling make update-translations).

When you change the translatable strings in the source code or page templates,
be sure to run

  make extract-translations


Virtual hosting
---------------

SchoolTool provides support for virtual hosting with Apache's mod_rewrite.
For example, let's say you have two SchoolTool instances running on ports
7001 and 7002, and you want to make them available as school1.example.org
and school2.example.org, both on port 80.  In order to do that, add the
following to your Apache configuration file:

  NameVirtualHost *:80

  <VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName school1.example.org
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteRule ^/(.*) http://localhost:7001/++vh++http:school1.example.org:80/$1 [P]
  </VirtualHost>

  <VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName school2.example.org
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteRule ^/(.*) http://localhost:7002/++vh++http:school2.example.org:80/$1 [P]
  </VirtualHost>

Also, enable mod_proxy and mod_rewrite.

See http://issues.schooltool.org/issue91 if you're interested why two rewrite rules
are needed for each virtual host.

You can also get SSL support in the same way, as an alternative to the build-in
SSL support:

  NameVirtualHost *:443

  <VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerName school1.example.org
    SSLEnable          # Apache 1.3
    # SSLEngine On     # Apache 2.0
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteRule ^/(.*) http://localhost:7001/++vh++https:school1.example.org:443/$1 [P]
  </VirtualHost>

The web application interface also supports virtual hosting in this manner,
the only differing thing would be the local port number.
